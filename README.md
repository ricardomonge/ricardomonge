## Research Focus

- **Psychometric Instrument Development**: Design, validation, and analysis of scales for measuring technostress, digital safety, academic integrity, student affect, and learning environments, using Aikenâ€™s V, EFA/CFA, and reliability metrics.

- **Technology and Digital Competence in Higher Education**: Study of studentsâ€™ and educatorsâ€™ experiences with learning objects, online platforms, AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT), and digital resource integration, with emphasis on self-efficacy and ethical challenges.

- **Evidence-Based Teaching and Learning Analytics**: Evaluation of pedagogical strategies, authentic assessment, and academic performance through quantitative methods, focusing on data-driven decisions for improving learning in STEM fields.

- **Machine Learning for Educational and Productivity Modeling**: Application of neural networks and deep learning techniques for estimating production frontiers and modeling academic or institutional performance.
